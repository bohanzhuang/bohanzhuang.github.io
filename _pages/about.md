My research is on Efficient Machine Learning (TinyML) and its applications on the edge. You can find my lab information and my publications at the top. 

I am actively seeking collaborations with leading institutions, particularly from the industry. If you possess a strong research background and share an interest in my research, I would be enthusiastic about collaborating with you.

I have stopped recruiting any research students affiliated with Monash University.
