I currently serve as a Research Professor at Zhejiang University and an Adjunct Faculty at Monash University. Previously, I was a tenured Assistant Professor at Monash University from 2020 to 2024. 

My research focuses on the co-design of efficient algorithms and systems for multimodal large foundation models.
