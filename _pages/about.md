I currently hold the position of research professor at Zhejiang University, and I also serve as an adjunct associate professor at Monash University, Australia. Previously, I was a tenured assistant professor at Monash University from 2020 to 2024. 

**I am leading [ZIP Lab](https://ziplab.github.io/), an international research lab located in both Hangzhou and Melbourne.** I am actively recruiting Visiting Scholars, Research Assistants, Research Fellows, Masters and PhDs at Zhejiang University. Additionally, I am seeking 1-2 PhD students at Monash University, who will also be co-supervised by senior faculty. If you are interested in my lab, please fill the [Google form](https://forms.gle/UoR8B19y2NsjtGRJ6) or the [Lark form](https://mxvxosxi7l.larksuite.com/share/base/form/shrusYz7yBXxAJuWfjkYVy5ZVee). 

My research focuses on Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) and its applications in multi-modality. 

My lab is actively pursuing collaborations with industry partners.
