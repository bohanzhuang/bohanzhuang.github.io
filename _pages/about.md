My research is on Efficient Machine Learning (TinyML) and its applications on the edge and you can find my lab information and my previous publications at the top. 

I am also seeking collaborations from flagship institutions, especially from the industry. If you are interested in my research, please drop me an email. 

I am making big things in 2023.
