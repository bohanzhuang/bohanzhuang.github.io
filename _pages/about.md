I am now a tenure-track assistant professor @ Monash University, since May 2020.

I am now leading the [Monash Green AI Lab](https://monashai.github.io/). 

During my PhD, I was honored to be advised by [Prof. Chunhua Shen](https://cshen.github.io/) and [Prof. Ian Reid](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~ianr/).
During my undergraduate, I was advised by [Prof. Huchuan Lu](https://www.google.com/search?q=huchuan+lu&oq=huchuan+lu&aqs=chrome..69i57j0i22i30l5.1619j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).


My main research topic is compressing and accelerating deep neural networks for resource constrained edge devices. And I also focus on a wide span of applications in Machine Learning and Computer Vision.  

Apart from academic, I'm a music enthusiast and have been playing piano since 4 years old.
