I am now a tenure-track assistant professor @ Monash University, since May 2020. 

I was advised by [Prof. Ian Reid](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~ianr/) and [Prof. Chunhua Shen](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~chhshen/).  

Research Fellow: 2018-2020    PhD: 2018   BEng: 2014   

My main research topic is compressing and accelerating deep neural networks for resource constrained edge devices. And I also focus on a wide span of applications in Machine Learning and Computer Vision.  

Apart from academic, I'm a music enthusiast and have been playing piano since 4 years old.
