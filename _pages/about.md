I am a Tenured Faculty Staff @ Monash University, Australia. I am an upcoming Hundred-Talent Program Professor @ Zhejiang University. 

**I am leading [ZIP Lab](https://ziplab.github.io/), an international chain lab located in both Hangzhou and Melbourne.** I am now actively recruiting Research Assistant, Research Fellow, Master and PhD students @ Zhejiang University. The lab's policy is available [here](/files/policy.pdf). If you are interested in my lab, pls drop an email to bohan dot zhuang at gmail dot com     

My research focuses on Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) and its applications in CV and NLP. 

My lab is actively pursuing collaborations with industry partners.
