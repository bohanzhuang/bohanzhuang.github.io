I am a tenured faculty @ Monash University, Australia. I am an upcoming faculty @ Zhejiang University. 

**I am leading [ZIP Lab](https://ziplab.github.io/), an international chain lab located in both Hangzhou and Melbourne.** I am now actively recruiting Research Assistant, Research Fellow, Master and PhD students @ Zhejiang University. I also occasionally recrute a very limited number of PhD students @ Monash University. If you are interested in my lab, please fill [this form](https://forms.gle/UoR8B19y2NsjtGRJ6). 

My research focuses on Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) and its applications in CV and NLP. 

My lab is actively pursuing collaborations with industry partners.
